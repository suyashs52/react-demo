            delivery of products or services through authorized delivery
            partners (“Service Providers”), subject to the terms outlined in
            this document.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            As a standard process, all orders placed on the Platform are treated
            as confirmed. However, after an order is placed, Greenox may contact
            the Customer via phone or email to verify order details, pricing,
            and estimated delivery timelines. For this purpose, Customers may be
            required to provide accurate information including name, mobile
            number, and email address. It is the Customer’s responsibility to
            promptly correct any incorrect information shared.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-2">
            Greenox may also reach out to the Customer to confirm or communicate
            changes related to product availability, pricing, or order
            modifications as informed by the vendor. Any such updated
            confirmation will be considered final. Greenox reserves the right to
            cancel an order if the Customer or vendor is unreachable at the time
            of verification, and in such cases, the Cancellation and Refund
